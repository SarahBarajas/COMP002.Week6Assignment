// 1. Write code to allow visitors of the page to customize it to their liking. There is a
// form on the page that accepts a name (to be used in a greeting when the user visits
// the page) and a color picker to allow the user to choose their preferred background
// color/foreground color combination. Write the necessary code to capture these values
// when the form is submitted (prevent the default action on the form submission button to
// achieve this) and store these values in localStorage (so that it persists on the userâ€™s
// computer and their preferences are saved indefinitely). Next, write a function to apply
// the preferences if they have been set and call it each time the page loads. You may
// also want to call this function again when the user saves their preferences to
// immediately apply them. Make sure you also notify the user somehow that the preferences
// were saved.

// Select the form and input elements from the HTML
const form = document.querySelector('form');
const nameInput = document.querySelector('#name');
const bgColorInput = document.querySelector('#bgcolor');
const fgColorInput = document.querySelector('#fgcolor');

// Function to apply the saved preferences from localStorage
function applyPreferences() {
    const name = localStorage.getItem('name'); // Get the stored name
    const bgColor = localStorage.getItem('bgcolor'); // Get the stored background color
    const fgColor = localStorage.getItem('fgcolor'); // Get the stored foreground color
